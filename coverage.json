The icon should visually represent stacked layers or blocks (evoking knowledge stacks, tech layers, or curriculum phases). The wordmark should read 'Stack Teacher' in a clean, modern, professional font. The overall style must be tech-educational: sharp, credible, and forward-looking, using the existing site color palette (dark backgrounds with accent tones). Produce the logo in a horizontal layout (icon left, text right) and a standalone icon-only variant.",
