The logo must use the site's existing OKLCH-based color palette (dark backgrounds with accent tones) to maintain visual consistency with the tech-educational aesthetic. The horizontal layout places the icon on the left and text on the right, sized at 400x100 pixels for navbar use."

Wrap the img in a Link component pointing to '/'. Apply responsive sizing: on desktop the logo displays at appropriate navbar height (e.g., h-10 or h-12); on mobile viewports (sm and below) either scale down proportionally or conditionally switch to the icon-only variant frontend/public/assets/generated/stack-teacher-icon.dim_128x128.png to prevent overflow. Add alt text 'Stack Teacher' for accessibility. Ensure the logo contrasts well against the header's existing background color (the header already uses a dark background per the site aesthetic)."
