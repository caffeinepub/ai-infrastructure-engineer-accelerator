  "summary": "The diff modifies 3 files but none of them appear to contain the actual replacement of 'compliance@stackteacher.com' with 'support@stackteacher.com'. The PrivacyPolicyPage.tsx content is truncated so it's unclear whether the email replacement was made there. The project_state.json still shows the feature as 'pending'. No direct evidence of the email replacement is visible in the diff.",
