  "summary": "The diff implements all three required features: a /terms route in App.tsx (REQ-1), a TermsOfUsePage component (REQ-2), and a Terms of Use footer link in Layout.tsx (REQ-3). However, the TermsOfUsePage.tsx file is truncated, making it impossible to fully verify that all 14 sections, ALL-CAPS disclaimer blocks, the support@stackteacher.com mailto link, the copyright line in Section 13, and all sub-sections are present and verbatim.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "All 14 section headings present and numbered correctly; ALL-CAPS disclaimer blocks (Sections 4 and 5) displayed in uppercase; support@stackteacher.com as a clickable mailto link; copyright line in Section 13; all bullet lists and sub-sections rendered completely.",
      "reason": "The TermsOfUsePage.tsx file is truncated in the diff, showing only the opening warning paragraph and the first 3 sections. It is impossible to confirm that all 14 sections, ALL-CAPS disclaimer blocks, the mailto link, the Section 13 copyright line, and sub-sections like Feedback, Mandatory Binding Arbitration, Class Action Waiver, Jury Trial Waiver, Small Claims, Emergency Relief, and Venue are present.",
