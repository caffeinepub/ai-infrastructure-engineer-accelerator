The PrivacyPolicyPage component was created with Stack Teacher branding, a styled cookies table, the /privacy-policy route was registered in App.tsx, and a Privacy Policy footer link was added in Layout.tsx. The diff is truncated so some details (phone number, compliance@ email, full cookies table columns) cannot be fully verified, but the visible evidence is consistent with all requirements being met.",
