  "summary": "All three requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 is satisfied by the footer link addition in Layout.tsx, REQ-2 is satisfied by the new RefundPolicyPage.tsx with all required sections and substitutions, and REQ-3 is satisfied by the route registration in App.tsx. The diff is truncated so full verification of all policy sections is limited, but visible content confirms correct branding substitutions and structure.",
