# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a Stack Teacher logo (horizontal and icon-only variants) and integrate it into the site's sticky header.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate a horizontal logo image combining a stacked-layers geometric icon with the "Stack Teacher" wordmark in a clean, modern sans-serif font, using the site's dark/teal-cyan color palette
- Generate a standalone icon-only variant of the stacked-layers mark in square format
- Update `Layout.tsx` to replace the existing text-only brand mark with the horizontal logo image, linked to the home page
- On mobile viewports, ensure the logo scales gracefully and does not overflow the header

**User-visible outcome:** The sticky header displays the Stack Teacher logo (icon + wordmark) instead of plain text, consistent with the site's tech-educational aesthetic, and the logo links back to the home page on all screen sizes.
